# Cleaning Up
---

Congratulations! You did it. You successfully deployed Kubernetes the Hard Way on Azure.
Pat yourself on the back. You deserve it.

Clean everything up from your Azure subscription with this one, extremely satisfying, command:

```sh
az group delete -g kubernetes
```

and prepare your favorite beverage!
